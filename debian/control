Description: enable audio input from the Microsoft Kinect sensor device
 When the Kinect is first plugged in the USB port it shows up as a
 generic USB device with a bulk endpoint; after uploading a certain
 firmware a reenumeration takes place and a USB Audio Class device
 becomes available.
 .
 kinect-audio-setup provides tools to download the firmware off the net
 at installation time —since it is not redistributable—, and it sets up
 udev rules to call the firmware loader when the device is plugged in to
 finally get the USB Audio Class device.
